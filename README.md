# Project Overview

This project was completed as a part of the course requirements of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree certification. In this project,
I worked with real-life data provided by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany.
Their main question of interest was to identify facets of the population that were most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign.
Several unsupervised learning techniques were necessary to be used to organize the general population into clusters and then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
